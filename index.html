            This week we will be learning .NET CORE basics and C# language to see if we understand it well.
            Goal of this week is creating some test pages and work around them to see if we can work with this framework or not.

        <p class="card-text">
            Last week we decided to look into .Net CORE, but it turns out that this framework is good, but it will take us way longer to learn and get used to in order to work with it.
            Keeping in mind that we only have less than a month left to finish this project. We are moving to our backup plan Django framework which uses Python.
            We will be using this framework to make our web app, as this framework is easier to learn and light weight to work with.
            In the meantime, we will also make a mockup design of our database to give us an idea of how our data will be realted to each other.

        <p class="card-text">
            Last week we moved from .NET CORE to Django and we learnd about it. We are glad that Django turned out to be suitable for our project.
            This week we will be desiging our own custom models (Teacher/Student) for our project and see how they work out.
            In the meantime, we will also design UI for pages like home, login, student/teacher dashboard and logout.

        <p class="card-text">
            Last week was a bit tough as designing you own custom models was noto as easy as we thought.
            We also have a login and dashboard temaplate for student.
            This weekâ€™s goal is to finish the custom models and start working on their relations and how they will be stored in the database.
            Also, we want to get the pages done this week as well.
            When we will have the proper models designed and we can make user out of those models. We will use user's info to bring them to right pages using decorators.

            Last weeks we were only able to half of the things done, so this week we still have to work on relationships and decorators.
            In the meantime, we will also start writing the final documentation for this project.
            Also we want to make a video before the deadline.
